\section{Reader Thread}
   cheaterStudent function reads file char by char,and pass homeworks to buffer.Buffer is protected by a semaphore to prevent mutual exclusion.This thread is exits if all homeworks read,money has finished or program should be close by signal.
\section{Student Thread}
    All student threads gets their student information by passing to function.Then they post readyWorker semaphore,to provide information to main thread that,a worker is ready to work and you can send homeworks.Then it waits for its own semaphore,which will be post after homework assigned.It process the homework and sleep until this loops starts again.
\section{Signal Handling}
    CTRL - C Signal will not close the program suddenly,it simply waits that all working operation to be completed and waits at most max sleep time,and it closes like normal.
